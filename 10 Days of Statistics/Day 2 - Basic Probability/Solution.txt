The total number of possibilities is 6*6=36.

Let P(A) denote find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.

We define P(B) to be the probability that the sum will be greather than 9.

This will result in: P(A) := 1 - P(B)

Out of all 36 cases there are only 6 possible combinations satisfying condition B:

{(4,6),(5,6),(6,4),(6,5),(5,5),(6,6)} ==> P(B) = 6/36 = 1/6

P(A) = 1- 1/6 = 5/6

Therefore the answer is 5/6.
